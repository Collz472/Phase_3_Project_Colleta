# **Predicting H1N1 and Seasonal Flu Vaccination Uptake**
## **Project Background**

Vaccination is a critical public health intervention for controlling and preventing the spread of infectious diseases. 
By providing immunization at an individual level and fostering herd immunity within communities, vaccines play a very important role in safeguarding global health. 
In 2009, the H1N1 influenza virus, commonly known as "swine flu," caused a global pandemic, resulting in an estimated 151,000 to 575,000 deaths worldwide in its first year. 
To combat this pandemic, an H1N1 vaccine was made available in October 2009.

The United States National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey, conducted in late 2009 and early 2010, collected data on vaccination uptake for both H1N1 and seasonal flu. 
The survey explored respondentsâ€™ vaccination status alongside information about their socioeconomic and demographic backgrounds, health behaviors, and opinions on vaccine efficacy and illness risk. 
This project therefore seeks to guide furture public health strategies by providing valuable insights into the factors influencing the vaccination patterns through a thorough analysis of the dataset provided.
